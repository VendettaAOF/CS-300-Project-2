•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects for this course taught me how to consider various data structures for solving complex problems. For the final project, I needed to store some data in a readable file and create data structures to take in that data and output in a specific way. 
•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
For the final project specifically, I looked at how the data I was going to be reading with my program was structured. Then I could start building out my data structures to take in that data by parsing through the file. 
•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I have a habit of testing each part of my code with print statements. If I get stuck on a section I’ll write debugging print statements on each line that I think I’m having an issue with. This method also helps me to follow along with the structure of my program. When specific functions get entered, or when loops start and stop, etc. This method isn’t very fast, but it helps me to keep my code structured better and clean.
•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I learned a lot on how to harness pointers and memory management in general. Especially when building out the Binary Search Tree. This data structure really pushed me to gain a better understanding of memory management, since this was where I found most of my bugs.
•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Absolutely. I’ve played around with forms of data structures before, but this project got me to really think about how data structures are essential for managing data in a clear and maintainable way. Without them, large datasets can become too much to manage. Causing programs to fail to run, or if they do run, they’ll be too slow to be useful.
